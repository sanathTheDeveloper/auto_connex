Auto Connex - Product Report 




1. Product Definition
Vision

AutoConnex is a B2B wholesale vehicle marketplace that redefines how licensed motor dealers and wholesalers connect, transact, and move inventory across Australia. The industry today operates on outdated networks (“traps”) or costly auction houses that extract significant fees. AutoConnex solves this by delivering a single national exchange where wholesalers can list vehicles instantly and dealers can discover, purchase, and arrange transport seamlessly.

Strategic Positioning
Where CarSales dominates the retail market, AutoConnex is positioned as the first nationwide wholesale marketplace. The platform offers wholesalers faster liquidity and higher margins while giving dealers broader, more efficient stock access. By modernizing the wholesale-to-dealer supply chain, AutoConnex unlocks efficiency in a multi-billion-dollar industry still stuck in legacy processes.


2. Problem & Opportunity — AutoConnex
Below are the core problems we’re solving, why they exist, and the scale of the opportunity. I’ve included third-party evidence for each.


Problem 1: Fragmented wholesale discovery (dealers can’t see national supply in one place)
What’s happening: Wholesale inventory is siloed across independent auction houses and wholesaler. Dealers must hop between Manheim, Pickles, Carlins, individual wholesaler or private networks, which is slow and opaque. There is no neutral, national aggregator focused on dealer↔wholesaler trade only.
Evidence of fragmentation
                                       * Major auction houses and wholesalers run separate, closed ecosystems (e.g., Manheim auctions, Pickles auctions/portals, Carlins dealer portal). A dealer must check each one.

                                       * Market data shows used-car supply has surged while prices cooled—so stock exists, but efficient discovery/matchmaking is the bottleneck. Cox Automotive reports dealer used selling prices fell back to ~Jan-2021 levels even as volumes stayed high; AADA/AutoGrab report a late-2024/early-2025 supply swell and a demand/supply mismatch. This conditions the need for faster, broader sourcing tools. Cox AutomotiveAutotalk Australia+1

Implication & opportunity: A single national marketplace that normalizes data, search and alerts (by make/model, grade, state, price, days-in-stock) collapses dealer sourcing time and increases clearance velocity for wholesalers. That creates fee revenue and strong network effects.


Problem 2: High frictional costs erode margins (auction fees + buyer’s premiums)
What’s happening: Dealers pay significant transaction fees to move wholesale metal through auctions. On lower-value vehicles, these fees consume a material share of gross.
Evidence of fee burden (AU)
                                          * Manheim AU: Cars & light commercials ≥$2,001 attract $650 + 1.5% buyer’s fee (effective Aug 2025). manheim.com.au

                                          * Pickles AU: Buyer fees on cars include $650 + 1.33% above $2,000 (plus other admin costs).

                                          * Carlins: Buyer’s premium $595 for >$3,001 (and $395 ≤$3,000) on top of hammer price. carlins.com.au

Implication & opportunity: A flat, transparent, lower take-rate (e.g., modest, tiered buy/sell fees) is immediately compelling to both sides. Under-pricing the incumbents (while adding discovery, logistics quotes, and compliance rails) is a credible wedge.


Problem 3: Manual, multi-step compliance & trust (PPSR + licensing) slows deals
What’s happening: Each trade requires clear-title checks (PPSR) and confidence that counterparties are licensed. Today, dealers do this ad-hoc across government portals—time-consuming and error-prone.
Evidence of the compliance burden
                                             * Dealers are legally expected to ensure clear title on used cars; PPSR is the government system and standard evidence (search certificate).


                                             * License verification is state-based and public (e.g., VIC LMCT public register; QLD Fair Trading licence check). Today, users must check each register manually. Consumer Affairs VictoriaQueensland Government

Implication & opportunity: AutoConnex can embed one-click PPSR pulls and automated licence checks (via public registers/APIs), auto-generate invoices with the PPSR certificate attached, and flag mismatches—reducing risk and time-to-trade. 


Problem 4: Logistics quoting & coordination adds friction—especially interstate
What’s happening: Australia’s geography makes interstate buying attractive but logistically fiddly. Dealers must hunt for transporters, estimate costs, and manage ETAs, delaying purchase decisions.
Evidence the logistics step is real and variable
                                                * Major carriers (e.g., CEVA) provide online quote & book flows and publish surcharge tables, implying non-trivial, variable costs that buyers want to know before committing.

                                                * Typical transit times are multi-day and route-dependent (e.g., Sydney↔Brisbane ~3–6 working days; longer routes often 1–2 weeks). Dealers need reliable, embedded estimates to price margins.

Implication & opportunity: AutoConnex can display instant, lane-based transport estimates (via partner rate cards/APIs) at the listing level and let buyers bundle freight into landed cost—accelerating commit/decline.


Problem 5: Information asymmetry & leakage in deal flow
What’s happening: When contact details are exchanged early (phone/email), deals “leak” off-platform to avoid fees. This undermines marketplace sustainability and data integrity.
Industry-standard mitigation: Mature marketplaces prevent early exchange of personal details and keep messaging in-app until a transaction is locked. (This is a proven pattern used by large platforms to defend take-rate and user safety.)
Implication & opportunity: AutoConnex should adopt anonymized profiles, in-app chat, masked phone/email, and release details only post-acceptance—plus enforceable T&Cs. This preserves unit economics and trust.


Problem 6: The market is large enough to sustain a vertical, B2B-only network
What’s happening: There are thousands of AU dealers and a sizeable cohort of wholesalers; used-vehicle throughput is in the millions annually. Even a small slice of dealer-to-dealer trades supports a strong fee business.
Evidence of market scale
                                                   * Dealers: ~3,798 new-vehicle dealerships nationwide (AADA 2025)—not counting many independent used-only yards. carlins.com.au

                                                   * Motor vehicle dealers (all): ~4,861 businesses in Australia (IBISWorld, 2024). AADA

                                                   * Motor vehicle wholesalers: ~1,126 businesses (IBISWorld, 2024)

                                                   * Used-car sales volume: 2.32 million used vehicles sold in 2024 (AADA/AutoGrab), with signs of late-year softening (supply > demand) and 2025 inventory rising—further reinforcing the need for efficient wholesale channels. Autotalk Australia

Implication & opportunity: Even capturing a conservative fraction of dealer↔wholesaler transactions with a sub-auction fee model yields meaningful revenue, while our compliance/logistics integrations increase stickiness and reduce churn.


What this means for AutoConnex (execution highlights)
                                                      1. Wedge with lower fees + better sourcing: Launch with transparent, tiered buy/sell fees below incumbent auction charges; pair with powerful alerts (“new Merc A250 < $X within 500km”) to drive daily use. 

                                                      2. Own trust & speed: One-click PPSR, automated licence checks, templated invoices, and in-app chat keep deals compliant and on-platform.

                                                      3. Embed freight economics: Show instant transport estimates on every listing (syndicated rate cards / APIs) so buyers can decide on a true landed basis.

                                                      4. Start focused, then expand: Begin in QLD/VIC lanes with a seeded set of wholesalers and targeted dealer segments (e.g., late-model fleet stock). Expand state-by-state as network density builds.

                                                                                                               * AutoConnex promise: “Set alerts for SUVs you need, get notified instantly, price them with freight included, and secure them before competitors.”



Strategic Takeaway
AutoConnex focuses on a two-sided market:
                                                                                                                  * Supply-side (1,151 wholesalers): They want reach & efficiency.

                                                                                                                  * Demand-side (~4,861 dealers, with 1,000+ used-only independents): They want inventory access & margin protection.

                                                                                                                  * Transport partners: An additional revenue enabler and differentiator that makes the model stickier.

This user base is large enough to sustain early traction in Queensland & Victoria, with clear expansion potential nationwide.


4. Competitive Landscape
1. Direct Competitors (Dealer-to-Dealer Marketplaces)
These platforms most closely overlap with AutoConnex because they enable wholesale vehicle transactions.
                                                                                                                     * Dealer Auction (Australia)

                                                                                                                        * Focus: Digital wholesale auction platform connecting dealers, wholesalers, and fleet sellers.

                                                                                                                        * Pricing: Subscription + transaction fees per vehicle sold.

                                                                                                                        * Strengths: Broad dealer network, established relationships with OEMs and fleets.

                                                                                                                        * Weaknesses: Auction-based system can be inefficient for dealers seeking instant inventory matching; lacks deep digital integration or real-time pricing intelligence.

                                                                                                                           * Manheim (part of Cox Automotive)

                                                                                                                              * Focus: Physical and online wholesale auctions; one of the largest in the world.

                                                                                                                              * Pricing: Seller fees, buyer fees, add-on services (transport, reconditioning).

                                                                                                                              * Strengths: Scale, trusted global brand, multi-channel access.

                                                                                                                              * Weaknesses: Auction-driven; operationally heavy; more suited to high-volume operators than smaller independents.

                                                                                                                                 * Pickles Auctions

                                                                                                                                    * Focus: Auctions across cars, trucks, industrial equipment.

                                                                                                                                    * Pricing: Seller/buyer commissions.

                                                                                                                                    * Strengths: Market trust, diversified auction categories.

                                                                                                                                    * Weaknesses: Generalist approach, not specialized for dealer-to-dealer efficiency.



3. Substitutes (Non-Digital / Traditional Methods)
                                                                                                                                       * Dealer Networks & Phone Brokers – Many dealers still rely on phone calls, personal networks, or local wholesalers to shift inventory. While trusted, these methods are manual, slow, and opaque.

                                                                                                                                       * Physical Wholesale Yards – Still common, but highly inefficient compared to digital solutions.

AutoConnex Differentiation
                                                                                                                                          * Instant Matching vs Auctions: Moves away from auction inefficiencies, focusing on streamlined dealer-to-dealer trades.

                                                                                                                                          * Transparency & Data Layer: Built-in pricing intelligence and verified dealers reduce friction.

                                                                                                                                          * Scalable Network Effects: As more dealers join, the marketplace efficiency compounds — positioning AutoConnex as infrastructure, not just a platform.
5. Pricing & Monetization Strategy 
1. Foundational Model (Early-Stage)
                                                                                                                                             * Free to List (Launch Phase)

                                                                                                                                                * Both wholesalers and dealers can list and browse inventory for free during the initial adoption period.

                                                                                                                                                * This minimizes friction and accelerates onboarding, solving the cold-start problem.

                                                                                                                                                   * Transaction-Based Fees

                                                                                                                                                      * Revenue is generated only when a successful transaction occurs.

                                                                                                                                                      * Both buyer and seller pay a flat fee, ensuring shared value capture.

                                                                                                                                                      * Suggested launch point: $350 each side per transaction.



2. Tiered Transaction Fees (Scalable Structure)
                                                                                                                                                         * To protect dealer margins on lower-value vehicles, fees scale with vehicle value:

                                                                                                                                                            * <$10,000 vehicle value → ~$150 fee per side

                                                                                                                                                            * $10,000–$20,000 → ~$250 fee per side

                                                                                                                                                            * $20,000+ → capped at ~$350 per side

This ensures fairness across vehicle categories and makes the platform viable for both budget and high-ticket stock.


3. Mid-to-Long Term Monetization Levers



                                                                                                                                                               * Premium Features (Subscription Add-Ons)

                                                                                                                                                                  * Advanced notifications (alerts when vehicles matching saved criteria are listed).

                                                                                                                                                                  * Priority access / “auto-buy” functions for high-demand stock.

                                                                                                                                                                  * Analytics dashboard (pricing trends, stock availability by region).

                                                                                                                                                                     * Transport Partnerships (Adjacency Revenue)

                                                                                                                                                                        * Integrated freight/transport quoting system with providers like Reardon’s or Seaver.

                                                                                                                                                                        * AutoConnex earns a “clip” on each transport booking, potentially a larger revenue driver than transaction fees long term.

                                                                                                                                                                        * With scale, this could offset platform fees and allow price flexibility to accelerate growth.



4. Investor Takeaway
                                                                                                                                                                           * The two-sided transaction fee model aligns AutoConnex with both buyers and sellers, while undercutting existing incumbents (Pickles/Mannheim).

                                                                                                                                                                           * Tiered pricing ensures fairness and encourages adoption across all vehicle categories.

                                                                                                                                                                           * Future upside through listing fees, premium subscriptions, and transport partnerships creates multiple revenue streams, de-risking reliance on a single model.


6. AutoConnex Market Size 
Methodology (what we measured & how)
Goal: size the entire wholesale used-vehicle transaction pool in Australia, then apply AutoConnex’s per-side fee model to quantify revenue potential.
What “wholesale” includes:
 B2B used-vehicle transactions between wholesalers ↔ dealers and fleet/government remarketers ↔ trade, whether via auctions or off-auction (direct, tender, dealer-to-dealer).

Manheim (the other national leader) reported +40.3% H1’24 wholesale volume vs. H1’23—evidence of large, rising auction flow.

How we estimated total wholesale transactions (units)
                                                                                                                                                                                 1. Auctions (observable): Triangulated from Pickles’ run-rate and Manheim growth → 150k (Low) / 170k (Base) / 200k (High) units/yr.

                                                                                                                                                                                 2. Off-auction wholesale from fleet remarketing (modeled): Start with 2.4M fleet vehicles; assume conservative annual replacement (Low 15% / Base 20% / High 25%) and that a majority of those disposals flow through wholesale B2B channels (Low 50% / Base 60% / High 70%), consistent with government/fleet auction practice. static.ibisworld.comIBISWorld

We deliberately keep the replacement rate and B2B share conservative; both are explicit assumptions. Where Australian point estimates are scarce, we anchor to public fleet scale and documented auction pathways and show sensitivity.

7. Final Recommendations & Key Considerations
1) Launch Thesis
                                                                                                                                                                                          * Win supply first, then curate demand. Liquidity in a B2B marketplace is supply-constrained early. Prioritize onboarding high-volume wholesalers (and major fleet remarketers) so dealers see fresh, relevant stock daily.

                                                                                                                                                                                          * Start narrow → expand. Phase 1 in Queensland → New South Wales, and within that, seed 2–3 vehicle segments with repeatable velocity (e.g., late-model SUVs, utes, and popular small cars). Add categories once sell-through is predictable.

                                                                                                                                                                                          * Keep behavior familiar. Default to bank transfer between parties; collect only the platform per-side fee in-app at “mutual accept.” Offer optional card/escrow later—don’t force new payment behavior at MVP.

2) Phased Rollout (90/180/365 days)
Phase 0–1 (0–90 days): MVP & Seed Liquidity
                                                                                                                                                                                             * Supply playbook. Personally onboard a first cohort of ~2–3 wholesalers (target ≥12 trades/month each). Offer 90 days of fee reductions or rebates in exchange for exclusive/first-look windows on a portion of stock.

                                                                                                                                                                                             * Listing friction ≈ zero. Free to list; one-tap rego decode; photo checklist; mandatory condition notes (pros/cons) and PPSR auto-attach at invoice.

                                                                                                                                                                                             * Anti-disintermediation v1. In-app chat with masked identities; no phone/email until fees captured; watermark images; unique listing IDs; terms explicitly prohibit off-platform closes for listed stock.

                                                                                                                                                                                             * Dealer access = controlled. Invite/waitlist dealers to maintain wholesaler:dealer balance; guarantee minimum buyer coverage per metro (e.g., 10–15 active buyers/category).

Phase 2 (90–180 days): Liquidity & Trust
                                                                                                                                                                                                * Pricing enforcement. Lock the tiered per-side fee ($150/$250/$350, both sides) and introduce volume rebates for power sellers (e.g., 10% fee credit at 50+ monthly sales).

                                                                                                                                                                                                * Reputation & SLAs. Launch ratings (fulfilment speed, accuracy), photo/condition standards, and dispute flow (fast mediation; fee credit if materially misdescribed).

                                                                                                                                                                                                * Transport monetization pilot. Integrate 1–2 partners (e.g., CEVA/independent carriers): instant estimates → book → small clip per movement. Don’t block DIY shipping.

                                                                                                                                                                                                * Verification at scale. Automate ABN/ACN + state dealer licence checks; keep manual fallback for edge cases.

Phase 3 (180–365 days): Scale & Monetize
                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Premium features (opt-in). Saved searches; instant notifications; “auto-buy” for pre-set criteria; priority placement. Keep listing free; monetize urgency.

                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Data products. Dealer comp sheets (buy bands by model/grade/kms), fair-value guides, and “days-to-clear” benchmarks → incremental ARPU and retention.

                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Geo expansion. Roll to VIC/SA/WA once QLD/NSW show sub-7-day median time-to-trade in 2+ categories.

3) Product Must-Haves (MVP → V1)
                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Core workflows: rego decode; 20-photo standard; structured defects; instant fee calc; accept/decline; invoice generation; fee capture on both sides at acceptance.

                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Trust & safety: dealer licence + ABN/ACN verification; PPSR check; odometer & write-off flags; private feedback loop for serious issues; audit trail on edits.

                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Dispute policy: simple remedies—refund platform fees; optional return protocol if materially misdescribed (wholesaler pays return freight if at fault).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Category imbalance: invite gates and waitlists; targeted demand subsidies; seller SLAs.

Bottom Line
Lead with frictionless listing, strict anti-circumvention, and real liquidity in two states and a few vehicle categories. Monetize with the agreed per-side fee, keep listings free, and use notifications/auto-buy and transport clips to expand ARPU after PMF. Track liquidity and trust relentlessly; if you hit <7-day sell-through in target categories with stable dispute rates, you have the engine to scale nationally.
